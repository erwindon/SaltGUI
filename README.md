# SaltGUI

A new open source web interface for managing a SaltStack server. Built using vanilla ES6 and implemented as a wrapper around the rest_cherrypy server.

The version tagged `release` is the latest released version. The version `master` should be fine, but it may contain changes that are not yet in these release-notes.

## Quick start using PAM as authentication method
- Install `salt-api` - this is available in the Salt PPA package which should already been installed if you're using Salt
- Open the master config /etc/salt/master
- Find `external_auth` and configure as following (see the note below!):
```
external_auth:
  pam:
    saltuser:
      - .*
      - '@runner'
      - '@wheel'
      - '@jobs'
```
- See `docs/PERMISSIONS.md` for more restricted security configurations.
- `saltuser` is a unix (PAM) user, make sure it exists or create a new one.
- At the bottom of this file, also setup the rest_cherrypi server to access SaltGUI from "http://localhost:3333" (or on any of the hostnames that the server has):
```
rest_cherrypy:
  port: 3333
  host: 0.0.0.0
  disable_ssl: true
  app: /srv/saltgui/index.html
  static: /srv/saltgui/static
  static_path: /static
```
- Note that the cherrypi server is part of the salt-api package and has no separate installation. It is configured using the master configuration file. When configured using the above configurations, both the api calls and the html/js files are served by the cherrypy server. Therefore no additional web application server is needed.
- Note that from the SaltGUI GIT repository, only the directory `saltgui` forms the actual SaltGUI web application.
- Replace each of the `/srv/saltgui` in the above config with the actual `saltgui` directory from the GIT repository. Alternatively, you can create a soft-link /src/saltgui that points to the actual saltgui directory.
- Restart everything with ``pkill salt-master && pkill salt-api && salt-master -d && salt-api -d``
- You should be good to go. If you have any problems, open a GitHub issue. As always, SSL is recommended wherever possible but setup is beyond the scope of this guide.

**Note: With this configuration, the `saltuser` user has access to all salt modules available, maybe this is not what you want**

Please read the [Permissions](docs/PERMISSIONS.md) page for more information.


## Authentication
SaltGUI supports the following authentication methods supported by salt:
- pam
- file
- ldap
- mysql
- yubico

Since pam by itself is already very powerfull, that one is mentionned as standard.
By default, it provides access to the Linux password file,
When other authentication methods need to be used their names can be added to file `saltgui/static/salt-auth.txt`.
There is one name per line in that file. Choose the authentication methods that are activated
in the salt-master configuration wisely, as the integrity of the salt-master and all salt-minions depends on it.

See the [EAUTH documentation](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/eauth/index.html) and the [Salt auth source code](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/tree/master/salt/auth) for more information.


## Command Box
SaltGUI supports entry of commands using the "command-box". Click on `>_` in the top right corner to open it.

Enter `salt-run` commands with the prefix `runners.`. e.g. `runners.jobs.last_run`. The target field can remain empty in that case as it is not used.

Enter `salt-call` commands with the prefix `wheel.`. e.g. `wheel.key.finger`. The target field will be added as named parameter `target`. But note that that parameter may not actually be used depending on the command.

Enter regular commands without special prefix. e.g. `test.ping`. The command is sent to the minions specified in the target field.

Commands can be run normally, in which case the command runs to completion and shows the results. Alternatively, it can be started asynchronously, in which case only a bit of progress information is shown. When variable `state_events` is set to `true`, then the progress is shown per state when applicable. Batch commands are not supported at this time.


## Output
SaltGUI shows the data that is returned by the Salt API.
Some variation can be achieved by modifying salt master configuration file `/etc/salt/master`.
e.g. (the default)
```
saltgui_output_formats: doc,saltguihighstate,json
```
`doc` allows reformatting of documentation output into more readable format. Also implies that only the result from one minion is used.
`saltguihighstate` allows reformatting of highstate data in a sorted and more readable format.
`json`, `yaml` and `nested` specify how all other output should be formatted. Only the first available of these formats is used.


## Time representation
The time formats used by Salt are very detailed and by default have 6 decimal digits to specify as accurate as nano-seconds. For most uses that is not needed. The fraction can be truncated to less digits by modifying salt master configuration file `/etc/salt/master`.
e.g.
```
saltgui_datetime_fraction_digits: 3
```
The value must be a number from 0 to 6.
Note that the effect is achieved by string truncation only. This is equivalent to always rounding downwards.


## Templates
SaltGUI supports command templates for easier command entry into the command-box.
The menu item for that becomes visible there when you define one or more templates
in salt master configuration file `/etc/salt/master`.
The field `targettype` supports the values `glob`, `list`, `compound` and `nodegroup`.
Entries will be sorted in the GUI based on their key.
You can leave out any detail field.
e.g.:
```
saltgui_templates:
    template1:
        description: First template
        target: "*"
        command: test.fib num=10
    template2:
        description: Second template
        targettype: glob
        target: dev*
        command: test.version
```


## Jobs
SaltGUI shows a maximum of 7 jobs in on the right-hand-side of the screen.
SaltGUI shows a maximum of 50 jobs on the dedicated jobs page.
Commands that are used internally in SaltGUI are hidden.

Additional commands to hide can be configured
in salt master configuration file `/etc/salt/master`.
e.g.:
```
saltgui_hide_jobs:
    - test.ping
```

Commands that are normally hidden can be made visible using configuration
in salt master configuration file `/etc/salt/master`.
e.g.:
```
saltgui_show_jobs:
    - grains.items
```


## Grains
Selected grains can be previewed on the Grains page.
The names of these grains can be configured
in salt master configuration file `/etc/salt/master`.
e.g.:
```
saltgui_preview_grains:
    - "osrelease_info"
```
The names can be specified as simple names like the example above.
Alternatively, the [grains.get](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/modules/all/salt.modules.grains.html#salt.modules.grains.get) notation can be used to get more detailed information. The separator is always `:`. e.g. `locale_info:timezone`.
Alternatively, the [jsonpath](https://www.w3resource.com/JSON/JSONPath-with-JavaScript.php) notation can be used to allow even more freedom. Jsonpath is used when the text starts with a `$`. e.g. `$.ip4_interfaces.eth0[0]`.


## Pillars
Pillars potentially contain security senstitive information.
Therefore their values are initially hidden.
Values become visible by clicking on them.
This behavior can be changed by adjusting the values of the configuration
in salt master configuration file `/etc/salt/master`.
The values for the pillar whose name match one of these regular expressions
are initially shown.
e.g.:
```
saltgui_public_pillars:
    - pub_.*
```


## Message-of-the-day
A message-of-the-day (motd) can be added to the login screen.
It can be used for any information, e.g.:
- legal statement
- system identification
- useful links to other systems
- informing users about system availability
- etc.

The text is stored in file `saltgui/static/salt-motd.txt` or `saltgui/static/salt-motd.html`. The first must be pre-formatted text only. The second one can contain full HTML text. Both are shown when they are present. Note that the message should not contain sensitive data, as its content is shown before logging in.

Alternatively, or additionally, the text can be retrieved from the `master` file entries `saltgui_motd_txt` and `saltgui_motd_html`. These entries can contain sensitive information because its content can only be retrieved after login. But it is still recommended to not let the text contain any sensitive data.


## Reduced menus
When apis are disabled using the native `external_auth` mechanism,
SaltGUI may show menu-items that have become unuseable.
In that case, it may be useful to reduce the menu-bar to less items.
Variable `saltgui_pages` is read 
from salt master configuration file `/etc/salt/master`.
It contains the list of accessible pages per user.
The first page in the list also becomes the landing page.
Users that are not listed still have the full menu.
e.g.:
```
saltgui_pages:
  user1:
    - keys
    - grains
```
Note that this is NOT a security mechanism to reduce what a user can do.
All pages are still accessible using their original deep-link.
And also any command can still be issued using the command-box.
For real security measures, use parameter `external_auth`.


## Performance
SaltGUI does not have artificial restrictions.
But displaying all data may be slow when there is a lot of data.
Most notorious is the display of a highstate with hundreds of minions, each with douzens of states.
SaltGUI can be forced to use a slightly simpler output by setting a parameter in salt master configuration file `/etc/salt/master`.
e.g.:
```
saltgui_tooltip_mode: simple
```
This parameter forces SaltGUI to use a very simple tooltip representation.
This is then the built-in version from the brower.
Typical effect is that it is shown slightly delayed and that is looks a bit primitive.
The only other allowed value is "none", with the effect that no tooltips are shown at all.


## Settings and statistics
By using ctrl-click on the SaltGUI logo in the top-left corner, an otherwise hidden page is made visible. The page shows the relevant settings from 3 categories on the left side and the api statistics on the right side.

First category contains the "session" details, which are the result of the login.
Second category contains the variables from the master file that are also relevant for SaltGUI.
The final category contains the variables that are specific to SaltGUI.
Simple variables with a limited range of values can be changed here for the duration of the current session. Permanent changes must be made in the master file.

The statistics panel is updated every 3 seconds.
Numeric fields that are known to contain timestamps are reformatted as readable strings.
Numeric fields that are known to contain durations are reformatted as readable strings.
Statistics for most threads that did not handle any requests yet are replaced by an empty string.
The amount of details shown depends on the parameter `collect_stats` in the `rest_cherrypy` block of the master file.


## Key administration
In situations like cloud hosting, hosts may be deleted or shutdown frequently.
But Salt remembers the key status from both.
SaltGUI can compare the list of keys against a reference list.
The reference list is maintained as a text file, one minion per line.
First column is the minion name.
Second column is `false` when the minion is known to be absent due to machine shutdown.
It should be `true` otherwise.
When the second column is missing, this validation is not performed.
Lines starting with `#` are comment lines.
The filename is `saltgui/static/minions.txt`.
Differences with this file are highlighted on the Keys page.
Minions that are unexpectedly down are highlighted on the Minions page.
When the file is absent or empty, no such validation is done.
It is suggested that the file is generated from a central source,
e.g. the Azure, AWS or similar cloud portals; or from a company asset management list.


## Separate SaltGUI host
In some specific environments you might not be able to serve SaltGUI directly from salt-api.
In that case you might want to configure a web server (for example NGINX) to serve SaltGui
and use it as proxy to salt-api so that requests are answered from the same origin from the browser point of view.

Sample NGINX configuration might look like this:
```
server {
  listen       80;
  server_name  _;
  root         /data/www;
  index        index.html;

  # handle internal api (proxy)
  location /api/ {
      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      proxy_set_header X-NginX-Proxy true;
      proxy_pass http://saltmaster-local:3333/;
      proxy_ssl_session_reuse off;
      proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
      proxy_redirect off;
  }

  # handle saltgui web page
  location / {
    try_files $uri /index.html;
  }

}
```

The value of the `API_URL` in the `config.js` file must point to path where salt-api is exposed.
The value of the `NAV_URL` in the `config.js` file must point to path where the SaltGUI application is exposed.
```
const config = {
  API_URL: '/api',
  NAV_URL: '/app'
};
```
Note that the main page of SaltGUI is then located at `/app/`. When you want `/app` to work as well, you should instruct an intermediate proxy server to translate `/app` into `/app/`.

> Currently you can't use totally independent salt-api without proxy as support for CORS preflight request is not properly support.


## Development environment with Docker
To make life a bit easier for testing SaltGUI or setting up a local development environment you can use the provided docker-compose setup in this repository to run a saltmaster with three minions, including SaltGUI:
```
cd docker
docker-compose up
```
Then browse to [http://localhost:3333/](http://localhost:3333/), you can login with `salt:salt`.


## Testing
We provide some functional tests and unit tests. They use the docker setup to run the functional tests. You will also need [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run them. When you have docker, yarn and node.js installed, you can run the tests from the root of the repository like this:
```
./runtests.sh
```

To show the browser window + a debugger while running the functional tests you can run:
```
NIGHTMARE_DEBUG=1 ./runtests.sh
```

We use the following testing libraries:
- [nightmare.js](https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare), for functional/browser tests
- [mocha](https://mochajs.org/), a well documented testing framework for javascript
- [chai](http://www.chaijs.com/), the preferred assertion library for testing

You'll need at least:
- `docker-compose` 1.12 or above
- `nodejs` 8.11 or above
- `yarn` 1.7 or above


## Contributing
Open a PR! Try to use no dependencies where possible, as vanilla JS is the aim. Any libraries will need to be heavily considered first. Please see the section above as PRs won't be reviewed if they don't pass the tests.
