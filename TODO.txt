Branch zzz-outputformat
("zzz" to move it to the bottom of the list)
PoC for supporting selectable output format in the JOB screen

PRO:
* previously, output format could only be seleced in the (hidden) Options screen, or in the master file.

CON:
* The implementation is a bit crude; with a long dropdown list with mostly technical items.

VERDICT:
Keep until there is an actual request for it
