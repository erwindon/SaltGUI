Branch zzz-subset
("zzz" to move it to the bottom of the list)
PoC for supporting subsets in `external_auth`
see also https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/eauth/index.html

PRO:
* previously, configured subsets usually leads to errors since SaltGUI still uses '*' as default pattern

CON:
* so far, few people need this. there was one request for it (https://github.com/erwindon/SaltGUI/pull/498) but that PR was not even finished.
* multiple permission sets do not seem to work properly in saltstack anyway

VERDICT:
Keep until there is an actual request for it
