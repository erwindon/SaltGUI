Branch zzz-multimaster
("zzz" to move it to the bottom of the list)
PoC for showing 'multimaster' data

PRO:
* it shows that/how minions are connected to other masters

CON:
* it does not work yet, because config.items does not return the orignal
  value for "master" (it returns only the current master)

VERDICT:
Keep until it is fixed
