Branch zzz-batch
("zzz" to move it to the bottom of the list)
PoC for executing commands as batch.

PRO:
* previously, batch mode is not supported

CON:
* the salt-api does not have facilities for incremental reporting
  user still has to wait until everything is done
* the results are returned individually or grouped in the jobs list
  there is no correlation, so it is hard to bundle the results later for presentation

VERDICT:
Keep until there is an actual request for it
