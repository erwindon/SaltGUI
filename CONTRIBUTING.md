Contributions to the SaltGUI projects are welcome!
This can either be through a pull-request (PR) or by creating an issue with an idea.

When you create an issue with an idea, make sure that:
* it is one idea/question at a time
* a new idea is useful for most users
* the `salt-api` calls to be used are mentionned when possible for new ideas

There are few coding standards:
* obey the rules from stylelint (for CSS)
* obey the rules from eslint (for JS)
* local functionnames start with "_"

When you create a PR, make sure that:
* it is one idea at a time
* it is as simple as possible
* it is useful for most users
* there are no errors from `eslint`
* there are no errors from `stylelint`
* there are coverage tests to cover all new non-gui code
* there are functional/gui tests to cover all new gui code
