# SaltGUI

A new open source web interface for managing a SaltStack server. Built using vanilla ES6 and implemented as a wrapper around the rest_cherrypy server.

## Features
- Login via PAM or any other supported authentication by Salt
- View minions and easily copy IPs
- Run state.highstate for a particular minion
- View the seven most recent jobs run on Salt
- Manually run any Salt function and see the output
- View the values for grains for a particular minion
- View the schedules for a particular minion
- View the values for pillars for a particular minion


## Quick start using PAM as authentication method
- Install `salt-api` - this is available in the Salt PPA package which should already been installed if you're using Salt
- Open the master config /etc/salt/master
- Find `external_auth` and configure as following (see the note below!):
```
external_auth:
  pam:
    saltuser:
      - .*
      - '@runner'
      - '@wheel'
      - '@jobs'
```
- See `docs/PERMISSIONS.md` for more restricted security configurations.
- `saltuser` is a unix (PAM) user, make sure it exists or create a new one.
- At the bottom of this file, also setup the rest_cherrypi server:
```
rest_cherrypy:
  port: 3333
  host: 0.0.0.0
  disable_ssl: true
  app: /srv/saltgui/index.html
  static: /srv/saltgui/static
  static_path: /static
```
- Replace `/srv/saltgui` in the above config with the directory containing the saltgui html/js source files.
- Restart everything with ``pkill salt-master && pkill salt-api && salt-master -d && salt-api -d``
- You should be good to go. If you have any problems, open a GitHub issue. As always, SSL is recommended wherever possible but setup is beyond the scope of this guide.

**Note: With this configuration, the `saltuser` user has access to all salt modules available, maybe this is not what you want**

Please read the [Permissions](docs/PERMISSIONS.md) page for more information.


## Authentication
SaltGUI supports the following authentication methods supported by salt:
- pam
- file
- ldap
- mysql
- yubico

See the [EAUTH documentation](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/eauth/index.html) and the [Salt auth source code](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/tree/2018.3/salt/auth) for more information.

## Output
SaltGUI shows the data that is returned by the Salt API.
Some variation can be achieved by modifying salt master configuration file `/etc/salt/master`.
e.g. (the default)
```
saltgui_output_formats: doc,saltguihighstate,json
```
`doc` allows reformatting of documentation output into more readable format. Also implies that only the result from one minion is used.
`saltguihighstate` allows reformatting of highstate data in a sorted and more readable format.
`json`, `yaml` and `nested` specify how all other output should be formatted. Only the first available of these formats is used.

## Time representation
The time formats used by Salt are very detailed and by default have 6 decimal digits to specify as accurate as nano-seconds. For most uses that is not needed. The fraction can be truncated to less digits by modifying salt master configuration file `/etc/salt/master`.
e.g.
```
saltgui_datetime_fraction_digits: 3
```
The value must be a number from 0 to 6.
Note that the effect is achieved by string truncation only. This is equivalent to always rounding downwards.

## Templates
SaltGUI supports command templates for easier command entry into the command-box.
The menu item for that becomes visible there when you define one or more templates
in salt master configuration file `/etc/salt/master`.
The field `targettype` supports the values `glob`, `list`, `compound` and `nodegroup`.
Entries will be sorted in the GUI based on their key.
You can leave out any detail field.
e.g.:
```
saltgui_templates:
    template1:
        description: First template
        target: "*"
        command: test.fib num=10
    template2:
        description: Second template
        targettype: glob
        target: dev*
        command: test.version
```

## Grains
Selected grains can be previewed on the Grains page.
The names of these grains can be configured
in salt master configuration file `/etc/salt/master`.
e.g.:
```
saltgui_preview_grains:
    - osrelease_info
```

## Pillars
Pillars potentially contain security senstitive information.
Therefore their values are initially hidden.
Values become visible by clicking on them.
This behavior can be changed by adjusting the values of the configuration
in salt master configuration file `/etc/salt/master`.
The values for the pillar whose name match one of these regular expressions
are initially shown.
e.g.:
```
saltgui_public_pillars:
    - pub_.*
```

## Development environment with Docker
To make life a bit easier for testing SaltGUI or setting up a local development environment you can use the provided docker-compose setup in this repository to run a saltmaster with three minions, including SaltGUI:
```
cd docker
docker-compose up
```
Then browse to [http://localhost:3333/](http://localhost:3333/), you can login with `salt:salt`.


## Testing
We provide some functional tests and unit tests. They use the docker setup to run the functional tests. You will also need [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run them. When you have docker, yarn and node.js installed, you can run the tests from the root of the repository like this:
```
./runtests.sh
```

To show the browser window + a debugger while running the functional tests you can run:
```
NIGHTMARE_DEBUG=1 ./runtests.sh
```

We use the following testing libraries:
- [nightmare.js](https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare), for functional/browser tests
- [mocha](https://https://mochajs.org/), a well documented testing framework for javascript
- [chai](http://www.chaijs.com/), the preferred assertion library for testing

You'll need at least:
- `docker-compose` 1.12 or above
- `nodejs` 8.11 or above
- `yarn` 1.7 or above


## Contributing
Open a PR! Try to use no dependencies where possible, as vanilla JS is the aim. Any libraries will need to be heavily considered first. Please see the section above as PR's won't be reviewed if they don't pass the tests.
